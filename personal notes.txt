i started this project, after talking to a TA, by first looking for the kernels system call table
i did this by using "grep -lr system_call" in the kernel
i chose this command because, since im looking for a system call table, looking for "system_call" seemed the most obvious place to start
i was presented with a bunch of folders, but one that stook out to me was "arch/x86/entry/entry_64_compat.S", this reason i chose
this folder specifically is because we were reminded in the project specs were working with an x86-64 architecture, so this made the most sense.

after i cd'ed into the "entry" folder, i did "ls" to show me its documents, and i found "syscall_64.tbl".
It couldnt be more obvious what the file that contained the system call table was at this point.

tests to do in fresh kernel:
1.start fresh kernel(PASS)
2.run heartbeat file, this will apply p1 and unzip tar(PASS)
3.run make && sudo make install && sudo make modules_install(PASS)
3.run test files(PASS)

sed -i -e 's/\r$//' heartbeat-p1.sh

1. is my man file good?
2. i understand youve told me multiple times my patch file is fine, but 
how are you confident it will pass? its not passing on my computer?
also, ive noticed other people have the same problem as i do, has there
been a solution?

youll be given a binary for next week and thatll test it for you
the way the binary works is that itll grade your project, and the grade will be encrypted
the way binary catches the messages is different but

if its seen that your score is obviously wrong,  a ta will run the grade on their computer.
3.can i share the testing file i made with others?

mention harness functions
